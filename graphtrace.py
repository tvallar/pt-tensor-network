    The tf.function decorator takes eager execution code and traces
    it to a computational graph that can be optimized for performance.
    However, these functions are retraced every time their call signature
    changes; there are some subtleties here that can cause
    this to occur much more often than you'd expect. This version provides
    the same functionality as tf.function but also keeps track of how many
    times each function has been traced, and prints a warning when they're
    being traced often.

    See https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/eager/tf_function for more
    information.
